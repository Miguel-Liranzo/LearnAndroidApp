# LearnAndroidApp
Final Project for Mobile Programming Course (Fall '22)

Primaryly focused on condensing all of the course's lesson topics into a local, easy-to-use application

- XML for the front-end
- Java for the back-end
- FireBase for the database

Users were prompted with a fully functioning login screen that utilized unique usernames and passwords.
Users could traverse the app freely and select from an array of topics which presented them with study materials from the chosen topic.
Study materials included: Links to previously recorded class sessions, offical Android documentation, Powerpoint Slideshows, tutorial code and a dynamic quiz that tested their knowledge on the subject.
Settings were included to give users a sense of personalization.
